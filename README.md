# **Fair Chance**

## **🎟️ Event Lottery System (CMPUT 301)**
A mobile Android application that enables fair, accessible event registration through a lottery‑based waiting list system. Entrants join events without racing to sign up, organizers manage events efficiently, and administrators maintain platform integrity.

## **✅ Core Functionality**
**Entrants** <br>
Entrants can browse and filter events, scan QR codes, and join or leave waiting lists with ease. They receive notifications when selected or not selected, and can accept or decline invitations directly in the app. Entrants also manage their profile, view event history, and are identified by their device without needing a password. <br>

**Organizers** <br>
Organizers create events with posters, QR codes, and registration windows, and can optionally require geolocation or limit waiting‑list size. They manage entrants through viewing waiting lists, running lottery draws, sending notifications, and drawing replacements when needed. Organizers can also update event posters and export final attendee lists in CSV format.<br>

**Administrators** <br>
Administrators maintain platform integrity by removing events, profiles, organizers, and uploaded images when necessary. They can browse all events, profiles, and images to ensure compliance with app policies. Administrators also review notification logs for auditing and moderation purposes.

## **💭 Why This App?**
By shifting event registration to a lottery‑based system, this app removes the pressure of first‑come, first‑served sign‑ups and creates a more equitable experience for everyone. Entrants can express interest on their own time, without needing to monitor registration windows or compete for limited spots. <br>
The system supports fairness, accessibility, and transparency for entrants, while giving organizers efficient tools to manage events and communicate with participants. It helps make community programming more inclusive, predictable, and stress‑free for all involved.
